SeaDrive OS X QuickLook generator.

## Development Guide

To build the seadrive qlgenerator and installs it to the system, run
the dev-build.sh which can be found in this directory.

```sh
cd seadrive-gui
qlgen/dev-build.sh -r
```

To test generating thumbnails, use the `qlmanage` command:

```
qlmanage -x -t /Users/<Name>/SeaDrive/path/to/file.jpg
```

Logs generated by seadrive qlgen can be found in system Console.app,
which is useful for debugging.
